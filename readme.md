## How to Sign In

To begin using TermCord, you need to sign in with your **Discord token**. This process is easy and quick:

1. **Obtain your Discord token**: 
   - You'll need to generate a token from Discord’s developer tools or use a token you already have from your Discord app.
   
2. **Sign in using the terminal**: 
   - Once you have your token, open the terminal and use the `!login` command followed by your token. Here’s the syntax:

   ```
   !login <your-token>
   ```

   For example:

   ```
   !login NzcwMjY4Mjc0NjU2ODMyODk0.QjqDSn.kvY2TWbcuhCO-JDNSx1t6UGlfo0
   ```

3. **Confirmation of successful login**:
   - After entering the command, TermCord will authenticate your token and log you into Discord. Once logged in, you’ll receive a welcome message like this:

   ```
   Welcome, <your-username>!
   ```

## GitHub Warning: Use at Your Own Risk

> [!WARNING]  
**Use of third-party clients may violate Discord’s Terms of Service!**  

Modifications and third-party clients are against Discord’s Terms of Service. While Discord has shown general indifference toward their usage, **there are no known cases** of users being banned simply for using client modifications like TermCord. However, it’s important to understand the risks before proceeding.

> [!CAUTION]  
**If your Discord account is very important to you**, and you cannot afford to have it disabled, you may want to reconsider using TermCord or any third-party client. Although it’s unlikely to result in a ban, using third-party clients always carries some level of risk. 

> [!TIP]  
**Use TermCord safely**: Stick to the inbuilt plugins provided by TermCord. These are safe to use and do not encourage abusive behavior. Avoid any third-party plugins that might break Discord's intended functionality or lead to a negative user experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
**Screenshots and Sharing**: Be cautious about sharing screenshots of TermCord in servers or communities where you might be at risk of being banned for using a third-party client. Always keep this in mind when engaging in Discord communities.
